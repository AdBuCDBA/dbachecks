# dbachecks

dbachecks is a framework created by and for SQL Server pros who need to validate their environments. Basically, we all share similar checklists and mostly just the server names and RPO/RTO/etc change.

This open source module allows us to crowdsource our checklists using [Pester](https://github.com/Pester/Pester) tests. Such checks include:

* Backups are being performed
* Identity columns are not about to max out
* Servers have access to backup paths
* Database integrity checks are being performed and corruption does not exist
* Disk space is not about to run out
* All enabled jobs have succeeded

Have questions about development? Please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/dbachecks/wiki). **Anyone developing this module** should visit that Wiki page (after fully reading this readme) for a brief overview.

## Prerequisites

* PowerShell 4+ is required.
* Automatic installation of the dependent modules will only be provided via the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com).

When you install from the Gallery, it'll auto-install:

* dbatools
* Pester
* PSFramework

When you import, it'll auto-import

* dbatools
* Pester
* PSFramework

## Getting started

Checks are performed using `Invoke-DbcCheck` which is basically a wrapper for [Invoke-Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Invoke-Pester). This means that supported `Invoke-Pester` parameters work against `Invoke-DbcCheck`.

In this module, a "Check" is synonymous with a "Tag" in Pester. So you can **Invoke-DbcCheck** and specify a Check that you want to run. You can see a list of the available Checks with **Get-DbcCheck**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/34329332-57f40a1c-e8fc-11e7-8526-178c415b09bf.png)

Once you've decided on the Check(s) you want to run, it's time to ensure you have a list of servers to run the checks against.

### Making server lists

Similar to the [dbatools](https://dbatools.io) module, dbachecks accepts `-SqlInstance` and `-ComputerName` parameters.

`Invoke-DbcCheck -SqlInstance $servers -Tags SuspectPage, LastBackup`

If you have a simplified (single) environment, however, you can set a permanent list of servers. "Servers" include both SQL Server instances and Windows servers. Checks that access Windows Server (e.g. disk space checks) will utilize `-ComputerName` parameter. A pure SQL Server command(s) (such as the backup check) utilizes the `-SqlInstance` parameter.

```powershell
# Set the servers you'll be working with
Set-DbcConfig -Name app.sqlinstance -Value sql2016, sql2017, sql2008, sql2008\express
Set-DbcConfig -Name app.computername -Value sql2016, sql2017, sql2008

# Look at the current configs
Get-DbcConfig

# Invoke a few tests
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tags SuspectPage, LastBackup
```
#### What it looks like

#### Other ways to execute checks against specific servers

Additional `Invoke-DbcCheck` examples:

```powershell
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag Backup -SqlInstance sql2016
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag RecoveryModel -SqlInstance sql2017, sqlcluster

$sqlinstance = Get-DbaRegisteredServer -SqlInstance sql2017 -Group Express
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag Backup -SqlInstance $sqlinstance

Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag Storage -ComputerName server1, server2
```

## Tag and ExcludeTag

We tag each of our Checks using singular descriptions such as Backup, Database or Storage. You can see all the Pester related Tags using `Get-DbcTagCollection` or `Get-DbcCheck`.

Each Check generally has a few Tags but at least one Tag is unique. This allows us to essentially name a Check and using these Tags, you can either include (`-Tag`) or Exclude (`-ExcludeTag`) in your results. The Exclude will always take precedence.

For example, the Database Tag runs a number of Checks including Backup Checks. The command below will run all Database Checks except for the Backup Checks.

```powershell
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag Database -ExcludeTag Backup -SqlInstance sql2016 -SqlCredential (Get-Credential sqladmin)
```

All valid [Pester](https://github.com/Pester/Pester) syntax is valid for dbachecks so if you'd like to know more, you can review their documentation.

## Reporting on the data

Since this is just PowerShell and Pester, results can be exported then easily converted to pretty reports. We've provided two options: Power BI and SMTP mail.

### Power BI Visualizations!

We've also included a pre-built Power BI Desktop report! You can download Power BI Desktop from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) or it is now offered via the [Microsoft Store on Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NTXR16HNW1T).

To use the Power BI report, pipe the results of `Invoke-DbcCheck` to `Update-DbcPowerBiDataSource` (defaults to `C:\Windows\temp\dbachecks`), then launch the included `dbachecks.pbix` file using `Start-DbcPowerBi`. Once the Power BI report is open, just hit **refresh**.

```powershell
# Run checks and export its JSON
Invoke-DbcCheck -SqlInstance sql2017 -Tags SuspectPage, LastBackup -Show Summary -PassThru | Update-DbcPowerBiDataSource

# Launch Power BI then hit refresh
Start-DbcPowerBi
```

The above report uses `Update-DbcPowerBiDataSource`'s `-Enviornment` parameter.

```powershell
# Run checks and export its JSON
Invoke-DbcCheck -SqlInstance $prod -Tags LastBackup -Show Summary -PassThru | Update-DbcPowerBiDataSource -Enviornment Prod
```

### Sending mail

We even included a command to make emailing the results easier!

```powershell
Invoke-DbcCheck -SqlInstance sql2017 -Tags SuspectPage, LastBackup -OutputFormat NUnitXml -PassThru |
Send-DbcMailMessage -To clemaire@dbatools.io -From nobody@dbachecks.io -SmtpServer smtp.ad.local
```

If you'd like to test locally, check out [PaperCut](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut/releases) which is just a quick email viewer that happens to have a built-in SMTP server. It provides awesome, built-in functionality so you can send the reports!

## Advanced usage

### Skipping some internal tests

The Check `LastGoodCheckDb` includes a test for data purity. You may be in an environment that can't support data purity. If this check needs to be skipped, you can do the following:

```powershell
Get-DbcConfig *skip*
Set-DbcConfig -Name skip.datapuritycheck -Value $true
```

Need to skip a whole test? Just use the `-ExcludeTag` which is auto-populated with both Check names and Pester Tags.

### Setting a global SQL Credential

`Set-DbcConfig` persists the values. If you `Set-DbcConfig -Name app.sqlcredential -Value (Get-Credential sa)` it will set the `SqlCredential` for the whole module, but not your local console! So cool.

You can also manually change the `SqlCredential` or `Credential` by specifying it in `Invoke-DbaCheck`:

```powershell
Invoke-DbaCheck -SqlInstance sql2017 -SqlCredential (Get-Credential sqladmin) -Tag MaxMemory
```

### Manipulating the underlying commands

You can also modify the parameters of the actual command that's being executed:

```powershell
Set-Variable -Name PSDefaultParameterValues -Value @{ 'Get-DbaDiskSpace:ExcludeDrive' = 'C:\' } -Scope Global
Invoke-DbcCheck -Tag Storage
```

## Can I run tests, not in the module?

If you have super specialized checks to run, you can add a new repository, update the `app.checkrepos` config and this will make all of your tests available to `Invoke-DbcCheck`. From here, you can pipe to `Send-DbcMailMessage`, `Update-DbcPowerBiDataSource` or parse however you would parse Pester results.

So first, add your repository

```powershell
Set-DbcConfig -Name app.checkrepos -Value C:\temp\checks -Append
```

Then add additional checks. We recommend using the [development guidelines for dbachecks](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/dbachecks/wiki).

## I don't have access to the PowerShell Gallery, how can I download this?

This module has a number of dependencies which makes creating a GitHub-centric installer a bit of a pain. We suggest you use a machine with [PowerShellGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/gallery/psget/get_psget_module) installed and Save all the modules you need

```powershell
Save-Module -Name dbatools, PSFramework, Pester -Path C:\temp
```

## Party

Nice work!
